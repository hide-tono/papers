    "\n",
    "Financial portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution of a fund into different financial products. This paper presents a financial-model-free Reinforcement Learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution to the portfolio management problem. The framework consists of the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward function. This framework is realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a trading period of 30 minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high commission rate of 0.25% in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous successful attempts of model-free and fully machine-learning schemes to the algorithmic trading problem, without predicting future prices, are treating the problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) one. These includeMoody and Saffell (2001), Dempster and Leemans (2006), Cumming (2015), and the recent deep RL utilization by Deng et al. (2017). These RL algorithms output discrete trading signals on an asset. Being limited to single-asset trading, they are not applicable to general portfolio management problems, where trading agents manage multiple assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep RL is lately drawing much attention due to its remarkable achievements in playing video games (Mnih et al., 2015) and board games (Silver et al., 2016). These are RL problems with discrete action spaces, and can not be directly applied to portfolio selection problems, where actions are continuous. Although market actions can be discretized, discretization is considered a major drawback, because discrete actions come with unknown risks. For instance, one extreme discrete action may be defined as investing all the capital into one asset, without spreading the risk to the rest of the market. In addition, discretization scales badly. Market factors, like number of total assets, vary from market to market. In order to take full advantage of adaptability of machine learning over different markets, trading algorithms have to be scalable. A general-purpose continuous deep RL framework, the actor-critic Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms, was recently introduced (Silver et al., 2014; Lillicrap et al., 2016). The continuous output in these actor-critic algorithms is achieved by a neural-network approximated action policy function, and a second network is trained as the reward function estimator. Training two neural networks, however, is found out to be difficult, and sometimes even unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper proposes an RL framework specially designed for the task of portfolio management. The core of the framework is the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology. An IIE is a neural network whose job is to inspect the history of an asset and evaluate its potential growth for the immediate future. The evaluation score of each asset is discounted by the size of its intentional weight change for the asset in the portfolio and is presented to a softmax layer, whose outcome will be the new portfolio weights for the coming trading period. The portfolio weights define the market action of the RL agent. An asset with an increased target weight will be bought in with additional amount, and that with decreased weight will be sold. Apart from the market history, portfolio weights from the previous trading period are also input to the EIIE. This is for the RL agent to consider the effect of transaction cost to its wealth. For this purpose, the portfolio weights of each period are recorded in a Portfolio Vector Memory (PVM). The EIIE is trained in an Online Stochastic Batch Learning scheme (OSBL), which is compatible with both pre-trade training and online training during back-tests or online trading. The reward function of the RL framework is the explicit average of the periodic logarithmic returns. Having an explicit reward function, the EIIE evolves, under training, along the gradient ascending direction of the function. Three different species of IIEs are tested in this work, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (Fukushima, 1980; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Sermanet et al., 2012), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (Werbos, 1988), and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a fully machine-learning approach, the framework is not restricted to any particular markets. To examine its validity and profitability, the framework is tested in a cryptocurrency (virtual money, Bitcoin as the most famous example) exchange market, Polonix.com. A set of coins are preselected by their ranking in trading-volume over a time interval just before an experiment. Three back-test experiments of well separated timespans are performed in a trading period of 30 minutes. The performance of the three EIIEs are compared with some recently published or reviewed portfolio selection strategies (Li et al., 2015a; Li and Hoi, 2014). The EIIEs significantly beat all other strategies in all three experiments \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic currencies, or simply cryptocurrencies, are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued moneys (Nakamoto, 2008; Grinberg, 2012). While the best known example of a cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, there are more than 100 other tradable cryptocurrencies competing each other and with Bitcoin (Bonneau et al., 2015). The motive behind this competition is that there are a number of design flaws in Bitcoin, and people are trying to invent new coins to overcome these defects hoping their inventions will eventually replace Bitcoin (Bentov et al., 2014; Duffield and Hagan, 2014). There are, however, more and more cryptocurrencies being created without targeting to beat Bitcoin, but with the purposes of using the blockchain technology behind it to develop decentralized applications. (For example, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, and Siacoin is the currency\n",
    "for buying and selling storage service on the decentralized cloud Sia.) To June 2017, the total market capital of all cryptocurrencies is 102 billions in USD, 41 of which is of Bitcoin.([Crypto-currency market capitalizations](http://coinmarketcap.com/)) Therefore, regardless of its design faults, Bitcoin is still the dominant cryptocurrency in markets. As a result, many other currencies can not be bought with fiat currencies, but only be traded against Bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two natures of cryptocurrencies differentiate them from traditional financial assets, making their market the best test-ground for algorithmic portfolio management experiments. These natures are decentralization and openness, and the former implies the latter. Without a central regulating party, anyone can participate in cryptocurrency trading with low entrance requirements. One direct consequence is abundance of small-volume currencies. Affecting the prices of these penny-markets will require smaller amount of investment, compared to traditional markets. This will eventually allow trading machines to learn and take advantage of the impacts by their own market actions. Openness also means the markets are more accessible. Most cryptocurrency exchanges have application programming interface for obtaining market data and carrying out trading actions, and most exchanges are open 24/7 without restricting frequency of tradings. These non-stop markets are ideal for machines to learn in the real world in shorter time-frames. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the portfolio management problem that this project is aiming to solve. Section 3 introduces asset preselection and the reasoning behind it, the input price tensor, and a way to deal with missing data in the market history. The portfolio management problem is re-described in the language RL in Section 4. Section 5 presents the EIIE meta topology, the PVM, the OSBL scheme. The results of the three experiments are staged in Section 6."

    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mathematical Formalism \n",
    "Portfolio management is the action of continuous reallocation of a capital into a number of financial assets. For an automatic trading robot, these investment decisions and actions are made periodically. This section provides a mathematical setting of the portfolio management problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Trading Period \n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, trading algorithms are time-driven, where time is divided into periods of equal lengths T. At the beginning of each period, the trading agent reallocates the fund among the assets. T = 30minutes in all experiments of this paper. The price of an asset goes up and down within a period, but four important price points characterize the overall movement of a period, namely the opening, highest, lowest and closing prices (Rogers and Satchell, 1991). For continuous markets, the opening price of a financial instrument in a period is the closing price from the previous period. It is assumed in the back-test experiments that at the beginning of each period assets can be bought or sold at the opening price of that period. The justification of such an assumption is given in Section 2.4.\n",

    "The portfolio consists of \\\\( m \\\\) assets. The closing prices of all assets comprise the price vector for Period \\\\( t \\\\),  \\\\( {\\boldsymbol v_t} \\\\).

Similarly, \\\\( {\\boldsymbol v^{(hi)}_t} \\\\) and \\\\( {\\boldsymbol v^{(lo)}_t} \\\\) denote the highest and lowest prices of the period. The first asset in the portfolio is special, that it is the quoted currency, referred to as the cash for the rest of the article. Since the prices of all assets are quoted in cash, the first elements of \\\\( v^{(lo)}_{0,t} \\\\), \\\\( {\\boldsymbol v^{(hi)}_t} \\\\) and \\\\({\\boldsymbol v^{(lo)}_t} \\\\) are always one, that is \\\\( v^{(hi)}_{0,t} = v^{(lo)}_{0,t} = v_{0,t} = 1, \\forall t \\\\). In the experiments of this paper, the cash is Bitcoin. For continuous markets, elements of \\\\( v^{(lo)}_{0,t} \\\\) are the opening prices for Period \\\\( t + 1 \\\\) as well as the closing prices for Period \\\\( t \\\\).

    "## 3. Data Treatments \n",
    "The trading experiments are done in the exchange Poloniex, where there are about 80\n",
    "tradable cryptocurrency pairs with about 65 available cryptocurrencies3. However, for the reasons given below, only a subset of coins is considered by the trading robot in one period. Apart from coin selection scheme, this section also gives a description of the data structure that the neural networks take as their input, a normalization pre-process, and a scheme to deal with missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Asset Pre-Selection \n",
    "In the experiments of the paper, the 11 most-volumed non-cash assets are preselected for the portfolio. Together with the cash, Bitcoin, the size of the portfolio, m + 1, is 12. This number is chosen by experience and can be adjusted in future experiments. For markets with large volumes, like the foreign exchange market, m can be as big as the total number of available assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for selecting top-volumed cryptocurrencies (simply called coins below) is that bigger volume implies better market liquidity of an asset. In turn it means the market condition is closer to Hypothesis 1 set in Section 2.4. Higher volumes also suggest that the investment can have less influence on the market, establishing an environment closer to the Hypothesis 2. Considering the relatively high trading frequency (30 minutes) compared to some daily trading algorithms, liquidity and market size are particularly important in the current setting. In addition, the market of cryptocurrency is not stable. Some previously rarely- or popularly-traded coins can have sudden boost or drop in volume in a short period of time. Therefore, the volume for asset preselection is of a longer time-frame, relative to the trading period. In these experiments, volumes of 30 days are used. However, using top volumes for coin selection in back-test experiments can give rise to a survival bias. The trading volume of an asset is correlated to its popularity, which in turn is governed by its historic performance. Giving future volume rankings to a backtest, will inevitably and indirectly pass future price information to the experiment, causing unreliable positive results. For this reason, volume information just before the beginning of the back-tests is taken for preselection to avoid survival bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Price Tensor \n",
    "Historic price data is fed into a neural network to generate the output of a portfolio vector. This subsection describes the structure of the input tensor, its normalization scheme, and how missing data is dealt with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the neural networks at the end of Period t is a tensor, Xt, of rank 3 with shape (f, n,m), where m is the number of preselected non-cash assets, n is the number of input periods before t, and f = 3 is the feature number. Since prices further back in the history have much less correlation to the current moment than that of recent ones, n = 50\n",
    "(a day and an hour) for the experiments. The criterion of choosing the m assets were given in Section 3.1. Features for asset i on Period t are its closing, highest, and lowest prices in the interval. Using the notations from Section 2.2, these are vi,t, v(hi)\n",
    "i,t , and v(lo)i,t . However,these absolute price values are not directly fed to the networks. Since only the changes in prices will determine the performance of the portfolio management (Equation (10)), all prices in the input tensor will be normalization by the latest closing prices. Therefore, Xt is the stacking of the three normalized price matrices,\n",
    "\n",
    "(18)\n",
    "\n",
    "with 1 = (1, 1, · · · , 1)⊺, and ⊘ being the element-wise division operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Period t, the portfolio manager comes up with a portfolio vector wt using merely the information from the price tensor Xt and the previous portfolio vector wt−1, according to some policy \u0019. In other words, wt = \u0019(Xt,wt−1). At the end of Period t + 1, the logarithmic rate of return for the period due to decision wt can be calculated with the additional information from the price change vector yt+1, using Equation (10), rt+1 = ln(μt+1yt+1 · wt). In the language of RL, rt+1 is the immediate reward to the portfolio management agent for its action wt under environment condition Xt. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Filling Missing Data \n",
    "Some of the selected coins lack part of the history. This absence of data is due to the fact that these coins just appeared relatively recently. Data points before the existence of a coin are marked as Not A Numbers (NANs) from the exchange. NANs only appeared in the training set, because the coin selection criterion is the volume-ranking of the last 30 days before the back-tests, meaning all assets must have existed before that. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the input of a neural network must be real numbers, these NANs have to be replaced. In a previous work of the authors (Jiang and Liang, 2017), the missing data was filled with fake decreasing price series with a decay rate of 0.01, in order for the neural networks to avoid picking these absent assets in the training process. However, it turned out that the networks deeply remembered these particular assets, that they avoided them even when they were in very promising up-climbing trends in the back-test experiments. For this reason, in this current work, flat fake price-movements (0 decay rates) are used to fill the missing data points. In addition, under the novel EIIE structure, the new networks will not be able to reveal the identity of individual assets, preventing them from making decision based on the long-past bad records of particular assets."

    "## 4. Reinforcement Learning \n",
    "With the problem defined in Section 2 in mind, this section presents a reinforcementlearning (RL) solution framework using a deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The explicit reward function is also given under this framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 The Environment and the Agent \n",
    "In the problem of algorithmic portfolio management, the agent is the software portfolio manager performing trading-actions in the environment of a financial market. This environment comprises of all available assets in the markets and the expectations of all market participants towards them. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossible for the agent to get total information of a state of such a large and complex environment. Nonetheless, all relevant information is believed, in the philosophy of technical traders (Charles et al., 2006; Lo et al., 2000), to be reflected in the prices of the assets, which are publicly available to the agent. Under this point of view, an environmental state can be roughly represented by the prices of all orders throughout the market’s history up to the moment where the state is at. Although full order history is in the public domain for many financial markets, it is too huge a task for the software agent to practically process this information. As a consequence, sub-sampling schemes for the order-history information are employed to future simplify the state representation of the market environment. These schemes include asset preselection described in Section 3.1, periodic feature extraction and history cut-off. Periodic feature extraction discretizes the time into periods, and then extract the highest, lowest, and closing prices in each periods. History cut-off simply takes the price-features of only a recent number of periods to represent the current state of the environment. The resultant representation is the price tensor Xt described in Section 3.2. Under Hypothesis 2 in Section 2.4, the trading action of the agent will not influence the future price states of the market. However, the action made at the beginning of Period t will affect the reward of Period t + 1, and as a result will affect the decision of its action. The agent’s buying and selling transactions made at the beginning of Period t+1, aiming to redistribute the wealth among the assets, are determined by the difference between portfolio weights w′ t and wt. w′ t is defined in term of wt−1 in Equation (7), which also plays a role in the action for the last period. Since wt−1 has already been determined in the last period the action of the agent at time t can be represented solely by the portfolio vector wt,\n",
    "\n",
    "at = wt. (19)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore a previous action does have influence on the decision of the current one through the dependency of rt+1 and μt+1 on wt (17). In the current framework, this influence is encapsulated by considering wt−1 as a part of the environment and inputting it to the agent’s action making policy, so the state at t is represented as the pair of Xt and wt−1, \n",
    "\n",
    "st = (Xt,wt−1), (20)\n",
    "\n",

The state st consists of two parts, the external state represented by the price tensor, Xt, and the internal state represented by the portfolio vector from the last period, wt−1.

    "\n",
    "It is the job of the agent to maximize the final portfolio value pf of Equation (11) at the end of the tf + 1 period. As the agent does not have control over the choices of the initial investment, p0, and the length of the whole portfolio management process, tf , this job is equivalent to maximizing the average logarithmic cumulated return R, \n",
    "\n",
    "(21)\n",
    "(22)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right-hand side of (21), wt−1 is given by action at−1, yt is part of price tensor Xt from state variable st, and μt is a function of wt−1, wt and yt as stated in (17). In the language of RL, R is the cumulated reward, and rt/tf is the immediate reward for an individual episode. Different from a reward function using accumulated portfolio value (Moody et al., 1998), the denominator tf guarantees the fairness of the reward function between runs of different lengths, enabling it to train the trading policy in mini-batches. \n",
    "With this reward function, the current framework has two important distinctions from many other RL problems. One is that both the episodic and cumulated rewards are exactly expressed. In other words, the domain knowledge of the environment is well-mastered, and can be fully exploited by the agent. This exact expressiveness is based upon Hypothesis 1 of Section 2.4 that an action has no influence on the external part of future states, the price tensor. This isolation of action and external environment also allows one to use the same segment of market history to evaluate difference sequences of actions. This feature of the framework is considered a major advantage, because a complete new trial in a trading game is both time-consuming and expansive. The second distinction is that all episodic rewards are equally important to the final return. This distinction, together with the zero-market-impact assumption, allows rt/tf to be regarded as the action-value function of action wt with a discounted factor of 0, taking no consideration of future influence of the action. Having a definite action-value function further justifies the full-exploitation approach, since exploration in other RL problems is mainly for trying out different classes of action-value functions. Without exploration, on the other hand, local optima can be avoided by random initialisation of the policy parameters which will be discussed below. \n",

    "### 4.3 Deterministic Policy Gradient \n",
    "\n",
    "A policy is a mapping from the state space to the action space, \u0019 : S → A. With full exploitation in the current framework, an action is deterministically produced by the policy from a state. The optimal policy is obtained using a gradient ascent algorithm. To achieve this, a policy is specified by a set of parameter \u0012, and at = \u0019\u0012(st). The performance metric of \u0019\u0012 for time interval [0, tf ] is defined as the corresponding reward function (21) of the interval, \n",

    "## 5. Policy Networks \n",
    "\n",
    "The policy functions \u0019\u0012 will be constructed using three different deep neural networks. The neural networks in this paper differ from a previous version (Jiang and Liang, 2017)\n",
    "with three important innovations, the mini-machine topology invented to target the portfolio management problem, the portfolio-vector memory, and a stochastic mini-batch online learning scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Network Topologies \n",
    "\n",
    "The three incarnations of neural networks to build up the policy functions are a CNN, a basic RNN, and a LSTM. Figure 2 shows the topology of a CNN designed for solving the current portfolio management problem, while Figure 3 portrays the structure of a basic RNN or LSTM network for the same problem. In all cases, the input to the networks is the price tensor Xt defined in (18), and the output is the portfolio vector wt. In both figures, an hypothetical example of output portfolio vector is used, while the dimension of the price tensor and thus the number of assets are actual values deployed in the experiments. The last hidden layers are the voting scores for all non-cash assets. The softmax outcomes of these scores and a cash bias become the actual corresponding portfolio weights. In order for the neural network to consider transaction cost, the portfolio vector from the last period, wt−1, is inserted to the networks just before the voting-layer. The actual mechanism of storing and retrieving portfolio vectors in a parallel manner is presented in Section 5.2. \n",
    "\n",
    "A vital common feature in all three networks is that the networks flow independently for the m assets while network parameters are shared among these streams. These streams are like independent but identical networks of smaller scopes, separately observing and assessing individual non-cash assets. They only interconnect at the softmax function, just to make sure their outputting weights are non-negative and summing up to unity. We call these streams mini-machines or more formally Identical Independent Evaluators (IIE), and this topology feature Ensemble of IIE (EIIE) nicknamed mini-machine approach, to distinguish with the wholesome approach in an earlier attempt (Jiang and Liang, 2017). EIIE is realized differently in Figure 2 and 3. An IIE in Figure 2 is just a chain of convolution with kernels of height 1, while in Figure 3 it is either a LSTM or a Basic RNN taking the price history of a single asset as input. \n",
    "\n",
    "EIIE greatly improves the performance of the portfolio management. Remembering the historic performance of individual assets, an integrated network in the previous version is more reluctant to invest money to a historically unfavorable asset, even if the asset has a much more promising future. On the other hand, without being designed to reveal the identity of the assigned asset, an IIE is able to judge its potential rise and fall merely based on more recent events. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical point of view, EIIE has three other crucial advantages over an integrated network. The first is scalability in asset number. Having the mini-machines all identical with shared parameters, the training time of an ensemble scales roughly linearly with m. The second advantage is data-usage efficiency. For an interval of price history, a mini-machine can be trained m times across different assets. Asset assessing experience of the IIEs is then shared and accumulated in both time and asset dimensions. The final advantage is plasticity to asset collection. Since an IIE’s asset assessing ability is universal without being restricted to any particular assets, an EIIE can update its choice of assets and/or the size of the portfolio in real-time, without having to train the network again from ground zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Portfolio-Vector Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the portfolio management agent to minimize transaction cost by restraining itself from large changes between consecutive portfolio vectors, the output of portfolio weights from the previous trading period is input to the networks. One way to achieve this is to rely on the remembering ability of RNN, but with this approach the price normalization scheme proposed in (18) has to be abandoned. This normalization scheme is empirically better performing than others. Another possible solution is Direct Reinforcement (RR)\n",
    "introduced by Moody and Saffell (2001). However, both RR and RNN memory suffer from the gradient vanishing problem. More importantly, RR and RNN require serialization of the training process, unable to utilize parallel training within mini-batches. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2: CNN Implementation of the EIIE: This is a realization the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE), a fully convolutional network. The first dimensions of all the local receptive fields in all feature maps are 1, making all rows isolated from each other until the softmax activation. Apart from weight-sharing among receptive fields in a feature map, which is a usual CNN characteristic, parameters are also shared between rows in an EIIE configuration. Each row of the entire network is assigned with a particular asset, and is responsible to submit a voting score to the softmax on the growing potential of the asset in the coming trading period. The input to the network is a 3×m×n price tensor, comprising the highest, closing, and lowest prices of m non-cash assets over the past n periods. The outputs are the new portfolio weights. The previous portfolio weights are inserted as an extra feature map before the scoring layer, for the agent to minimize transaction cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, inspired by the idea of experience replay memory (Mnih et al., 2016), a dedicated Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), is introduced to store the network outputs. As shown in Figure 4, the PVM is a stack of portfolio vectors in chronological order. Before any network training, the PVM is initialized with uniform weights. In each training step, a policy network loads the portfolio vector of the previous period from the memory location at t − 1, and overwrites the memory at t with its output. As the parameters of the policy networks converge through many training epochs, the values in the memory also converge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing a single memory stack allows a network to be trained simultaneously against data points within a mini-batches, enormously improving training efficiency. In the case of RNN versions of the networks, inserting last outputs after the recurrent blocks (Figure 3)\n",
    "avoids passing the gradients back to the deep RNN structures, circumventing the gradient vanishing problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3: RNN (Basic RNN or LSTM) Implementation of the EIIE: This is a recurrent realization the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE). In this version, the price inputs of individual assets are taken by small recurrent subnets. These subnets are identical LSTMs or Basic RNNs. The structure of the ensemble network after the recurrent subnets is the same as the second half of the CNN in Figure 2. \n",

Red memories are being read to the policy network, while blue ones are being overwritten by the network. The two colored rectangles in (a) consisting of four strips are example of two consecutive mini-batches. While (a) exhibits a complete read and write circle for a minibatch, (b) shows a circle within a network (omitting the CNN or RNN part of the network). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Online Stochastic Batch Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of the network output-memory, mini-batch training becomes plausible, although the learning framework requires sequential inputs. However, unlike supervised learning, where data points are unordered and mini-batches are random disjoint subsets of the training sample space, in this training scheme the data points within a batch have to be in their time-order. In addition, since data sets are time series, mini-batches starting with different periods are considered valid and distinctive, even if they have a significantly overlapping interval. For example, if the uniform batch size is nb, data sets covering [tb, tb+nb)\n",
    "and [tb + 1, tb + nb + 1) are two validly different batches. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ever-ongoing nature of financial markets means new data keeps pouring into the agent, and as a consequence the size of the of training sample explodes indefinitely. Fortunately, it is believed that the correlation between two market price events decades exponentially with the temporal distance between them (Holt, 2004; Charles et al., 2006). With this belief, here an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme is proposed. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the tth period, the price movement of this period will be added to the training set. After the agent has completed its orders for period t + 1, the policy network will be trained against Nb randomly chosen mini-batches from this set.

A major disadvantage of APV is that it does not measure the risk factors, since it merely sums up all the periodic returns without considering fluctuation in these returns. A second metric, the Sharpe ratio (SR) (Sharpe, 1964, 1994), is used to take risk into account.

    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "This article proposed an extensible reinforcement-learning framework solving the general financial portfolio management problem. Being invented to cope with multi-channel market inputs and directly output portfolio weights as the market actions, the framework can be fit in with different deep neural networks, and is linearly scalable with the portfolio size. This scalability and extensibility are the results of the EIIE meta topology, which is able to accommodate many types of weight-sharing neural-net structures in the lower level. To take transaction cost into account when training the policy networks, the framework includes a portfolio-weight memory, the PVM, allowing the portfolio-management agent to learn restraining from oversized adjustments between consecutive actions, while avoiding the gradient vanishing problem faced by many recurrent networks. The PVM also allow parallel training within batching, beating recurrent approaches in learning efficiency to the transaction cost problem. Moreover, the OSBL scheme governs the online learning process, so that the agent can continuously digest constant incoming market information while trading. Finally, the agent was trained using a fully exploiting deterministic policy gradient method, aiming to maximize the accumulated wealth as the reinforcement reward function. \n",

    "scale here. The two EIIEs are leading throughout the entire time-span, growing consistently only with a few drawdown incidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The profitability of the framework surpasses all surveyed traditional portfolio-selection methods, as demonstrated in the paper by the outcomes of three back-test experiments over different periods in a cryptocurrency market. In these experiments, the framework was realized using three different underlining networks, a CNN, a basic RNN and a LSTM. All three versions better performed in final accumulated portfolio value than other trading algorithms in comparison. The EIIE networks also monopolized the top three positions in the risk-adjusted score in all three tests, indicating the consistency of the framework in its performances. Another deep reinforcement learning solution, previously introduced by the authors, was assessed and compared as well under the same settings, losing too to the EIIE networks, proving that the EIIE framework is a major improvement over its more primitive cousin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6: Back-Test 2: 2016-12-08-4:00 to 2017-01-28-8:00 (UTC), log-scale accumulated weath. This is the worst experiment amung the three back-tests for the EIIEs. However, they are able to steadily climb up till the end of the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the three EIIE networks, LSTM had much lower scores than the CNN and the basic RNN. The significant gap in performance between the two RNN species under the same framework might be an indicator to the well-known secret in financial markets, that history repeats itself. Not being designed to forget its input history, a vanilla RNN is more able than a LSTM to exploit repetitive patterns in price movement for higher yields. The gap might also be due to lack of fine-tuning in hyper-parameters for the LSTM. In the experiments, same set of structural hyper-parameters were used for both basic RNN and LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the success of the EIIE framework in the back-tests, there is room for improvement in future works. The main weakness of the current work is the assumptions of zero market impact and zero slippage. In order to consider market impact and slippage, large amount of well-documented real-world trading examples will be needed as training data. Some protocol will have to be invented for documenting trade actions and market reactions. If that is accomplished, live trading experiments of the auto-trading agent in its current version can be recorded, for its future version to learn the principles behind market impacts and slippages from this recorded history. Another shortcoming of the work is that the framework has only been tested in one market. To test its adaptability, the current and later versions will need to be examined in back-tests and live trading in a more traditional financial market. In addition, the current award function will have to be amended, if not abandoned, for the reinforcement-learning agent to include awareness of longer-term market reactions. This may be achieved by a critic network. However, the backbone of the current framework, including the EIIE meta topology, the PVM, and the OSBL scheme, will continue to take important roles in future versions. \n",

    "Figure 7: Back Test 3: 2017-03-07-4:00 to 2017-04-27-8:00 (UTC), log-scale accumulated weath. All algorithms struggle and consolidate at the beginning of this experiment, and both of the EIIEs experience two major dips on March 15 and April 9. This diving contributes to their high Maximum Drawdown in the text (Table 2). Nevertheless, this is the best month for both EIIEs in term of final wealth."
